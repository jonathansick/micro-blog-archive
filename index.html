			 <p>I started reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781541768710">Value(s)</a> by Mark Carney 📚 My goal is to read Carney’s and Freeland’s books over the Canadian Liberal leadership race. Both are highly impressive, which bodes well for our future.</p>

			 <p>-21˚C and the furnace gave up last night. Thankfully we have some redundant forms of heating and some friends dropped off extra space heaters so we should be able to keep things going until a tech arrives.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Speaking of Krugman going indie, I find it curious that even established writers are offloading platform ownership to Substack in return for the benefit of its network and (I guess?) simple technical set up. What happens when Substack stops being cool or culturally palatable?</p>

			 <p>I was let down when I heard that Paul Krugman was retiring from the New York Times — this is until I found that he&rsquo;s got a new <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/paulkrugman">home on Substack</a> and is commenting with ever more frequency on economics and (of course) politics. Highly recommended and paywall free (for now?)</p>

			 <p>We watched <em>Wild Robot</em> last night 🍿 As new parents, the story line hit hard in a good way.</p>
<p>I appreciated the dystopian undertones of the movie — like the Golden Gate Bridge being underwater.</p>
<p>And if you’re an ecologist, just try to suspend belief for about an hour for best effect.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781953953483">Boom</a> by Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber 📚</p>
<p>The book’s idea is that useful bubbles — characterized by irrational exuberance, shared optimism, and overinvestment — are important drivers of innovation (think of bubbles as things like the Apollo program and development of the microchip rather than purely financial delusions like the 2008 financial crisis). In that sense, the current AI bubble can be seen as useful because it’s concentrating huge amounts of R&amp;D on a shared vision of the future. And just like the dot-com bubble popped but left behind the network infrastructure necessary for the Internet we rely upon today, the AI bubble may leave behind important software and computing paradigms even if Nvidia&rsquo;s stock crashes.</p>
<p><em>Boom</em> also has its weird and sometimes eye-roll-worthy moments. The first part of the book tries to explain that we&rsquo;re currently mired in a Great Stagnation compared to the rapid developments of the mid-century. One of the things it blames for stagnation is the monoculture of university campuses — as if wokeness is to blame for a lack of innovation. The book ends with a philosophical and somewhat theological discussion of bubbles and progress that frankly didn&rsquo;t land with me at all in audiobook format.</p>
<p>The middle stretch of the book is quite nice, though, as a survey of key technological developments in the last century and how a bubble-type environment brought them about.</p>
