Like her other books, Peng delivers at given a slightly weird story where the characters exist in and out of liminal spaces.</p>

			 <p>After a long time away, I had my first kayak outing of 2024 in Georgian Bay this morning. First I spotted a little mink scurrying on the shore while checking out a patch of invasive glossy buckthorn. Then several turtles, followed by a bald eagle fly-over. So rewarding to be back on the water.</p>

I shiplapped the panels together by cutting rabbets with my router. As a fun highlight, I painted the rabbets green. To get the reveal between the panels just right, I used 5 mm plastic shims. This was also an opportunity to update the plugs and switches from the grimy &rsquo;70s hardware we had before.</p>

<h2 id="doing-the-work">Doing the work</h2>
<h3 id="documentation-engineering-for-phalanx">Documentation engineering for Phalanx</h3>
<p>My highlight for October at <a href="https://www.lsst.org">Rubin Observatory</a> was overhauling the <a href="https://phalanx.lsst.io">documentation for Phalanx</a>. Phalanx is how we deploy the Rubin Science Platform across different environments, whether it&rsquo;s in Google Cloud or at institutional data facilities. The first phase of that work was to re-organize (and in many cases, edit and augment) the content into core categories (Overview, Application Developers, and Environment Administrators). I think the <a href="https://documenteer.lsst.io/guides/index.html">new theme</a> is really working well for this purpose, with the top-level sections clearly defining different domains in the documentation.</p>
<p>On top of that narrative documentation, I built out two reference categories for applications and environments. These pages are intended to provide quick access to information about apps and environments. You can get a link to an application in an environment&rsquo;s Argo CD, or see what environments an application runs in, or see what groups are configured with different authorization scopes, and so on. All of this information is already embedded within the Phalanx repository (an Argo CD GitOps repo, <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/phalanx">lsst-sqre/phalanx</a>), so I engineered the Sphinx documentation build to pull the necessary information automatically. Essentially, in the Sphinx <code>conf.py</code> file I fire off a Python service that crawls the Phalanx repository&rsquo;s Helm charts to collect datasets for each app and service. These get loaded in Jinja templating environments for <a href="https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-jinja/">sphinx-jinja</a>, which I use to render out templated reStructuredText content, such as tables, just in time for the Sphinx documentation build. These are the things I really love about docs-like-code and a system like Sphinx ‚Äî there are lots of entry points for creating very custom documentation tooling that enable us to document things accurately and efficiently.</p>
<h3 id="technote">Technote</h3>
<p>In November, I started working on a brand-new project called <em>Technote</em>. It&rsquo;s on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/technote">lsst-sqre/technote</a>. At Rubin, we&rsquo;ve been using technical notes or &ldquo;technotes&rdquo; since 2015 when we introduced them. You can read in <a href="https://sqr-000.lsst.io">SQR-000</a> why we created the technote format, and how we use it. The gist is that technotes are a lightweight documentation format for communicating within and across teams that is built on GitHub as the core platform for collaboration, and static web servers as the presentation platform (in our case, <a href="https://sqr-006.lsst.io"><em>LSST the Docs</em></a>, but you could use GitHub Pages or Read the Docs effectively too).</p>
<p>Initially, we created technotes just for ourselves in SQuaRE, but over time the format was organically adopted by more and more teams throughout the observatory. There are several hundred technotes already at Rubin (you can find them at <a href="https://www.lsst.io">www.lsst.io</a>). Although the format took off, the Rubin technote platform stayed on the original Sphinx prototype theme I created in 2015 ‚Äî a hacked version of the Read the Docs theme. And yes, you can now write technotes in LaTeX, but HTML-native technotes are still at the heart of the platform.</p>
<p>This month, at last, I carved out work time to start properly engineering the technote document format. At its core, the <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/technote">Technote</a> package provides a Sphinx theme that&rsquo;s geared towards single page articles (i.e., technotes) that have a title, document identifier, abstract, and other metadata like author lists and versioning information. <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/technote">Technote</a> is a base layer, so organizations like Rubin and others can customize the branding and design of their documents. The long-term goal is to enable team members to write technotes in reStructuredText, Markdown, or Jupyter Notebooks, and render technotes in HTML, EPUB, and PDF (for archives). It&rsquo;s early days, but I think there&rsquo;s considerable potential in enabling teams to write documents on GitHub that are shared on the web.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;ve been making a lot of progress down in the woodshop, but my current goal is to organize the shop space into something that&rsquo;s functional for both woodworking / making and also home storage.</p>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m panelling a small section of wall under the stairs in maple plywood. I&rsquo;ve ship lapped the panels and painted the rabbets with a splash of mint green. That wall will become the future home for my tool chest and a network cabinet.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>Amanda and I have been reading <em>The Golden Enclaves</em>, the third book in Naomi Novak&rsquo;s Scholomance series. They&rsquo;ve made it out of the Scholomance ‚Äî now they&rsquo;re facing the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world of wizards.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been on a personal knowledge management kick, trying to figure out how to build a system for gathering information and making it accessible to me. I read Tiago Forte&rsquo;s <em>Building a Second Brain</em>, which I think is a system that has a lot of good ideas. I&rsquo;ve also been re-reading <em>How to take smart notes</em> by Sonke Ahrens, who teaches the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettlekasten</a> system of literature notes and atomic permanent notes ‚Äî and leaves project management aside. In some ways Ahrens' approach is more appealing because I can see it scaling more easily than Forte&rsquo;s approach of literally moving notes from one bucket to another. I&rsquo;m working out how all of these ideas can become a personal knowledge management system for myself, centred around DEVONthink.</p>
<h2 id="heavy-rotation">Heavy rotation</h2>
<p>Carly Rae Jepson and Taylor Swift both released albums on the same day, so apologies to other artists but these are all I&rsquo;ve been listening to lately.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in love with CRJ&rsquo;s <em>The Loneliest Time</em>, and the title track with Rufus Wainright is my personal hit for the year. I also especially love <em>Surrender My Heart</em>, <em>So Nice</em>, and <em>Shooting Star</em>. Actually, every song is a banger. Full stop.</p>
<h2 id="on-screen">On screen</h2>
<p>Season 6 of the <em>Great Canadian Baking Show</em> was a fantastic display of diversity. Don&rsquo;t pay any attention to the dribble that the <em>Walrus</em> publishes about it.</p>
<p><em>Sort of</em> season 2 on CBC Gem started and it&rsquo;s a brilliant masterpiece.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also started watching <em>Orphan Black</em>, which I missed out on when it originally aired. Tatiana Maslany&rsquo;s acting is astonishing.</p>

			 <h2 id="doing-the-work">Doing the work</h2>
<p>September was all about shipping the new system for <a href="https://www.lsst.org">Rubin Observatory</a> user guides in <a href="https://documenteer.lsst.io">Documenteer</a>. When I first started working on documentation for Rubin back in 2015, I always struggled with getting <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">Sphinx</a> documentation themes to do exactly what we wanted. For years I told my colleagues we&rsquo;d fix all the issues ‚Äî from typography to navigation to branding and more&hellip; eventually. Now I think we&rsquo;ve finally got to a point where we are shipping polished documentation sites we can really be proud of. And the best part is I didn&rsquo;t have to do the ground-up production of a custom Sphinx theme. Instead, we used the new and awesome <a href="https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">PyData Sphinx Theme</a> as an open source foundation. I really appreciate how the PyData folks have thought through the customization and branding use cases. For example, CSS custom properties make it a snap to apply Rubin&rsquo;s brand colours in both light and dark themes. In the past this would have been a fraught task that yielded rather fragile CSS overrides.</p>
<p>What I spend most of the month though was <em>productizing</em> the user guide theme and configuration for the Rubin organization. Sphinx documentation projects use a Python module, called <code>conf.py</code> for configuration. To help Rubin projects use the same core configuration (and therefore benefit from consistent features and branding), we provide a configuration module in Documenteer that each project can import into its <code>conf.py</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>from documenteer.conf.guide import *
</code></pre>
<p>Each project still needs to customize its Sphinx configuration in many ways. The technically simple way to do this is to have each project extend the core configuration in its <code>conf.py</code> file. But in some cases this is tricky because you need to customize existing lists and dictionary provided by the core configuration. It&rsquo;s just awkward and error prone.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve done instead is introduced a file, called <code>documenteer.toml</code>, where a user can configure their project. The <code>documenteer.conf.guide</code> configuration merges this information with the Sphinx <code>conf.py</code> file for you. This lets us also do smart and semi-automated configuration. For instance, if a project is a Python package, the configuration can automatically pull out the project&rsquo;s name, version, and repository URL.</p>
<pre><code>[project]
title = &quot;Documenteer&quot;
copyright = &quot;2015-2022 Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA)&quot;

[project.python]
package = &quot;documenteer&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Overall, the <code>documenteer.toml</code> file means we can document and support a well defined set of configuration that each Rubin documentation project can manipulate.</p>
<p>Within Rubin Observatory, this is the sort or work that I find both satisfying and also really powerful from an organizational perspective. We&rsquo;re able to take together elements of the open source ecosystem, edit and mix them together, and then provide and document a simple interface that other members and teams in the observatory can use in their own work. Rather than personally running all the documentation sites for the entire observatory, I can help the entire observatory create their own documentation. That&rsquo;s how a small team like ours can have an outsized influence on an organization.</p>

<p>Amanda and I joined our friend couple on a hike to McCrae Lake Conservation Reserve, a popular site just north of us that&rsquo;s the beginning of the Canadian shield country. The purpose of the trip was to take some wedding anniversary shots for our friends, and they turned out adorably cute. I also flew the drone and managed to capture a glimpse of a beaver near it&rsquo;s lodge. <a href="https://youtu.be/SmSpYLl2q8U" title="The Beaver Pond at McCrae Lake">I put the video up on YouTube.</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting the hang of Lumafusion and even had some fun mixing some nature sounds and atmospheric sound tracks from the Audiio library. Video editing gets easier the more you do it, and I could see this being something I want to keep doing more.</p>
<p>Down in the workshop I&rsquo;ve been slowly getting the sliding trays for the tool chest project. I got the tray slides in (made from white oak) and milled the pine stock for the trays themselves.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>Finished reading <em>The Thursday Murder Club</em> by Richard Osman, <em>After Dark</em> by Haruki Murakami, and <em>Make Time</em> by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. <em>Make Time</em> is a quick book with loads of strategies to experiment with for getting better at focusing. Amanda and I started reading <em>Husband Material</em> by Alexis Hall together, which is the sequel to <em>Boyfriend Material.</em></p>

<p>Amanda and I went to see Carly Rae Jepson play in Ontario Park in Toronto for her <em>So Good</em> tour. And it was <em>so good.</em> Every song of hers is a hit and she sounded amazing with her band. Bleachers opened for her and it was really cool to see Jack Antonoff for the first time.</p>

			 <p>August is an odd month. It&rsquo;s both the height of summer while also feeling like the end of summer up here.</p>
<h2 id="doing-the-work">Doing the work</h2>
<p>This month, I got back into the user interface for <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/times-square">Times Square</a> on the Rubin Science Platform (<a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone">Squareone</a>). Now when you pull request changes to a notebook repository, Times Square will not only verify that notebooks execute cleanly, but it will also give you a link to view the rendered notebooks (<a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/84" title="Add page for viewing PR-preview pages">lsst-sqre/squareone#84</a>. I think this feature will make publishing notebooks to the Times Square platform easier for Rubin staff, and will promote a pull request-based workflow.</p>
<p>On YouTube, I stumbled upon a video by Chantastic (of React podcast fame) about <a href="https://youtu.be/i5tvZ9f7gJw">setting up Storybook with Next.js</a>. <a href="https://storybook.js.org">Storybook</a> is an app for developing and documenting components (such as React components) in isolated contexts. I&rsquo;ve known of Storybook for a while in the context of learning about design systems (hat tip to <a href="https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com"><em>Atomic Design</em> by Brad Frost</a>), but I&rsquo;d always considered it to be something for big teams that had the resources to set up design documentation infrastructures for their web projects. Well, it turns out that not only is Storybook amazingly easy to drop into an existing React application, but it also solves some glaring problems in my web development workflow. React components can have behaviours that depend on state. Working with state while developing components can be, quite frankly, a pain. With Storybook, I can now inject state into &ldquo;stories&rdquo; about my components, and even adjust that state in real time to see how the component adapts. You can see this initial Storybook related work in <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/87" title="Initial integration with Storybook">lsst-sqre/squareone#87</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/93" title="Develop Times Square UI with storybook">lsst-sqre/squareone#93</a>.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the month, I moved on to another Rubin web project: theming Rubin&rsquo;s Sphinx documentation sites. We&rsquo;re trying out <a href="https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">pydata-sphinx-theme</a>, which features a three column design (navigation ‚Äî content ‚Äî content headers) and a novel top navigation bar. Because that top navigation bar is populated from the root-level <code>toctree</code> elements of a Sphinx site, adopting <a href="https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">pydata-sphinx-theme</a> can take some content re-organization. I&rsquo;ve implemented the theme in <a href="https://documenteer.lsst.io">Documenteer</a>, and I really like the result. My pull request to set up a Rubin configuration for Sphinx documentation is <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/documenteer/pull/129" title="Adopt pydata-sphinx-theme">lsst-sqre/documenteer#129</a></p>
<h2 id="pursuits">Pursuits</h2>
<p>Down in the wood shop (I can&rsquo;t decide whether I want to call it a <em>wood shop</em> or <em>workshop</em> or even a <em>studio</em>) I made solid progress on my tool chest, based on the boarded chest in the <a href="https://lostartpress.com/products/the-anarchists-design-book"><em>Anarchist&rsquo;s Design Book</em></a> by Schwarz. I used my combination plane to make rabbets and nailed the chest walls together with fantastically-strong 2&quot; cut nails. Then I used the combination plane to make tongue-and-groove joints for the bottom boards and nailed each board on, again with the 2&quot; cut nails. I slightly mis-aligned one board while nailing it, and after failing to pull out the nails, realized that these cut nails have fantastic holding strength. I&rsquo;m not worried about the chest bottom falling out. Now I&rsquo;ve pivoted to making a set of low Krenovian saw horses to temporarily hold the chest at a workable height before I make a permanent stand (which could be months, years, or decades down the road).</p>
<p>Amanda and I got out for a bit more kayaking, and I shot and edited together <a href="https://youtu.be/vSK9JYTC_Mc">a short video of us paddling around</a>. It&rsquo;s kind of dorky, but it&rsquo;s also astonishing to think that we now have consumer-grade flying cameras that can follow people around perfectly.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>Finished reading <em>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</em> by Haruki Murakami, <em>The Book of M</em> by Peng Shepard, and <em>Boyfriend Material</em> by Alexis Hall. Resumed the Gabriel Allon series with Amanda: we&rsquo;re on <em>The Rembrandt Affair</em> by Daniel Silva.</p>
<h2 id="heavy-rotation">Heavy rotation</h2>
<p>The tracking on my U-Turn Orbit turntable went for a (literal) loop this month. Something about the anti-skip being a bit too strong, I think? But I really enjoyed listening to records of She &amp; Him&rsquo;s <em>Melt Away: A Tribute to Brian Wilson</em> and Lizzo&rsquo;s <em>Special.</em> I must have had Sylvan Esso&rsquo;s <em>No Rules Sandy</em> on repeat through most work days. And after watching Dua Lipa&rsquo;s episode on <em>Song Exploder,</em> I dug a bit into her <em>Future Nostalgia</em> album.</p>

			 <p>This is the first edition of what I intend to be a monthly round-up of the month. I&rsquo;m doing this a bit for you ‚Äî to keep tabs on what I&rsquo;m up to ‚Äî and also a bit for me to reflect on where my focus and effort are.<a href="The%20idea%20of%20a%20weekly%20review%20comes%20from%20David%20Sparks,%20who%20talks%20about%20it%20frequently%20on%20his%20%5BMacSparky%20blog%5D(https://www.macsparky.com)%20and%20in%20training%20courses.%20Reviews%20are%20also%20a%20bit%20part%20of%20productivity%20methodolgies%20taught%20by%20%5BThe%20Focus%20Course%5D(https://thefocuscourse.com)%20and%20%5BGetting%20Things%20done%5D(https://gettingthingsdone.com).">FN</a></p>
<h2 id="doing-the-work">Doing the work</h2>
<p>I started the month wrapping up basic <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/times-square/pull/41">GitHub Checks integration</a> for Times Square, a dynamic Jupyter notebook publishing service for the Rubin Science Platform. Times Square is in semi-stealth mode (they&rsquo;re both currently public open source), but I can&rsquo;t wait to see how they get used by Rubin teams.</p>
<p>Next, I spent some time working on a new Cookiecutter template for <a href="https://github.com/lsst/templates/tree/main/project_templates/square_pypi_package">&ldquo;SQuaRE-style&rdquo; Python packages that are published to PyPI</a>. We&rsquo;ve been informally copying the same patterns between our major libraries like <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/safir">Safir</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/documenteer">Documenteer</a>, but this template formalizes the basic structure for a SQuaRE package. It also provided us a chance to update our best practices. For instance, we&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.jonathansick.blog">switched to pyproject.toml entirely for project metadata, as I wrote about on this blog.</a> Second, I wanted to find a way to make our common GitHub Actions workflows more maintainable. It turns out that composite GitHub Actions are a low-overhead way of grouping sequences of actions together. The result is that the &ldquo;user&rdquo; workflows are both shorter and have less code to maintain since all the logic is now maintained in centralized actions. So far I&rsquo;ve made three composite actions: <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/run-tox">lsst-sqre/run-tox</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/ltd-upload">lsst-sqre/ltd-upload</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/build-and-publish-to-pypi">lsst-sqre/build-and-publish-to-pypi</a>.</p>
<p>I refreshed some of the Kafka infrastructure that SQuaRE uses internally and provides to the rest of Rubin Observatory. First, I updated the packaging for <a href="https://kafkit.lsst.io">Kafkit</a>, our Python package for encoding Kafka messages in conjunction with the Confluent Schema Registry. Kafkit is also available on conda-forge now at <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/kafkit-feedstock">conda-forge/kafkit-feedstock</a>. I also overhauled Strimzi Registry Operator, our Kubernetes operator for deploying the Confluence Schema Registry on a Strimzi-deployed Kafka cluster. One bit of that refresh I&rsquo;m really happy with is <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/strimzi-registry-operator/pull/57">a PR that deploys Kafka, the operator, and a Schema Registry in minikube within GitHub Actions</a>. This technique for building an application within minikube has a lot of potential as way of running integration tests for a lot of our microservices.</p>
<p>Lastly, I&rsquo;ve also been thinking more about my online presence, including the viability of Instagram and my years-long absence from Twitter. I&rsquo;ve started to invest effort into <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> as a way of owning my content and cross-posting to Twitter and Instagram where it makes sense. Social media was really important for launching my career, but while working Rubin I&rsquo;ve let it all drop off. It feel like it&rsquo;s time to re-emerge, but on my own terms. I feel like we&rsquo;re doing a lot of cool stuff at Rubin, and it&rsquo;s time to share it with the world now that we&rsquo;re getting closer to first light.</p>
<h2 id="pursuits">Pursuits</h2>
<p>I got a DJI Mini 3 micro drone. The technology is astounding. I&rsquo;ve been steadily learning its flying functionality and just barely digging into its camera functionality. I&rsquo;m also playing around with editing the drone footage on my iPad with LumaFusion. It really feels like the future.</p>

			 <p>We just released version 0.5.0 of the <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/strimzi-registry-operator">Strimzi Registry Operator</a> (see <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/strimzi-registry-operator/releases/tag/0.5.0">release notes</a>). Strimzi Registry Operator helps you run a <a href="https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html">Confluent Schema Registry</a> for a <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> cluster that&rsquo;s managed by the fabulous <a href="https://strimzi.io">Strimzi operator</a> for Kubernetes. The Schema Registry allows you to efficiently encode your Kafka messages in <a href="https://avro.apache.org">Avro</a>, while centrally managing their schemas in the registry.</p>
<p>With the Strimzi Registry Operator, you deploy a Kubernetes resources like this:</p>
<pre><code>apiVersion: roundtable.lsst.codes/v1beta1
kind: StrimziSchemaRegistry
metadata:
  name: confluent-schema-registry
spec:
  listener: tls
  securityProtocol: tls
  compatibilityLevel: forward
</code></pre>
<p>The operator deploys a Schema Registry server based on that <code>StrimziSchemaRegistry</code> resource and takes care of details like mapping the Kafka listener and converting the mutual TLS certificates into the JKS formatted keystore and truststore required by the Schema Registry.</p>
<p>We at Rubin Observatory&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre">SQuaRE</a> team created the Strimzi Registry Operator back in 2019 to help us deploy an internal Kafka to power our ChatOps. Since then, this technology has become critical for other Rubin applications like the alert broker and the engineering facilities database (telemetry from the telescope facility). We&rsquo;ve also gotten hints that the operator has been adopted by other Strimzi users, which we&rsquo;re thrilled to hear of. Open source in action! ‚ú®</p>

<p>Anyways, I was using httpie&rsquo;s <code>@=</code> <a href="https://httpie.io/docs/cli/non-string-json-fields">feature for embedding file content in a JSON field</a> within a GitHub Actions workflow and got an error:</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t <em>think</em> I was doing anything with passing standard input, and the command was running just fine locally, so I spent a good while finding possible solutions.

<p>First, a reminder of what&rsquo;s going on with Python packaging. <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/">PEP 517</a> and <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/">PEP 518</a> introduced the idea of a &ldquo;build-system independent format for source trees.&rdquo; Up to that point, the assumption was that all Python projects would be built with setuptools.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> A build-system independent format lets you specify an alternative build backend, but in a standardized way, so that a front-end like <code>pip</code> can build and install the package regardless. In the SQuaRE team, though we use setuptools, we embraced PEP 517 and added <code>pyroject.toml</code> files containing a <code>[build-system]</code> table. However, our project metadata remained in <code>setup.cfg</code>, where setuptools expects it.</p>
<p>Then in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/">PEP 621</a>, Python introduced a standardized schema for storing a project&rsquo;s metadata (everything from its name to its dependencies) in a <code>[project]</code> table of <code>project.toml</code> files. At this point, it seemed as if we could finally drop <code>setup.cfg</code> files from our projects entirely.</p>
<p>Well, almost. The last straw was for setuptools itself to support <code>pyproject.toml</code> configurations for aspects of the build that are specific to setuptools, like package discovery. Currently, the support for a <code>[tool.setuptools]</code> table in pyproject.toml is in beta, but it exists and that was good enough for our team to start supporting it.</p>
<p>And with that, we can now package our Python projects with only a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file, dropping <code>setup.cfg</code> and (almost) <code>setup.py</code> (more on this later).</p>
<h2 id="our-template-pyprojecttoml">Our template pyproject.toml</h2>
<p>This is the example pyproject.toml from our template (and here&rsquo;s the related <a href="https://github.com/lsst/templates/blob/main/project_templates/square_pypi_package/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.pypi_name%7D%7D/pyproject.toml">Jinja2/cookiecutter template</a> for it). You can also <a href="https://github.com/lsst-sqre/kafkit/blob/main/pyproject.toml">see it in action with Kafkit</a>, one of our Python packages for Kafka.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This <code>pyproject.toml</code> is built for a &ldquo;src/&rdquo; Python package layout. The <code>[tool.setuptools.packages.find]</code> table is where we configure this.</p>
<h2 id="setuppy-is-still-necessary-for-now">setup.py is still necessary, for now</h2>
<p>Our original goal with this new template was to do away with the &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; packaging files: <code>setup.cfg</code> and <code>setup.py</code>. We did succeed in doing away with <code>setup.cfg</code> since not only has <code>setuptools</code> moved to <code>pyproject.toml</code>, but nearly every other tool using <code>setup.cfg</code> has moved their configurations as well.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>It might seem like <code>setup.py</code> is also obsolete. However, in our experience, some projects still require it for editable installs <code>pip install -e .</code>. We often use editable installs during development to rapidly test and prototype, so this is a useful feature for us. For that reason, we&rsquo;ve had to re-add a basic <code>setup.py</code> file to our projects:</p>
<pre><code>from setuptools import setup

setup()
</code></pre>
<p>What&rsquo;s surprising is that, anecdotally, not all setuptools-based projects seem to need a <code>setup.py</code> for their editable installs.</p>
<p>Regardless, <a href="https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2816">setuptools issue 2816</a> is worth a subscription to learn when this has changed.</p>
<h2 id="concatenated-readmes-with-markdown-may-not-work">Concatenated READMEs with Markdown may not work</h2>
<p>With the new <code>[project]</code> table in <code>pyproject.toml</code>, you can set a <code>readme</code> field that links to your project&rsquo;s README file. This effectively replaces the old &ldquo;long description&rdquo; field, where, back in the <code>setup.py</code> days, we&rsquo;d write a small function to open and insert text from the README file. This is a nice, clean way of standardizing that practice.</p>
<p>Something I liked to do in our <code>setup.cfg</code> files was to actually concatenated multiple files into the long description:</p>
<pre><code>[metadata]
name = documenteer
long_description = file: README.rst, CHANGELOG.rst, LICENSE
long_description_content_type = text/x-rst
</code></pre>
<p>This way, the project&rsquo;s page on PyPI would include not only the README but also the change log, followed by the license. Nice.</p>
<p>In <code>pyproject.toml</code>, the same can be accomplished by making the README <em>dynamic</em>:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
dynamic = [&quot;readme&quot;]

[tool.setuptools.dynamic]
readme = {file = [&quot;README.rst&quot;, &quot;CHANGELOG.rst&quot;]}
</code></pre>
<p>And this works. Where things went wrong for me is using Markdown for the README and CHANGELOG:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
dynamic = [&quot;readme&quot;]

[tool.setuptools.dynamic]
readme = {file = [&quot;README.md&quot;, &quot;CHANGELOG.md&quot;]}
</code></pre>
<p>When I looked inside the built wheel&rsquo;s <code>METADATA</code> file, the <code>Description-Content-Type</code> would be <code>text/re-structured-text</code> instead of <code>text/markdown</code>. Normally, the tooling successfully detects the content type for the description, but this may not be working for dynamic READMEs. Something to be aware of, as setuptools' <code>pyproject.toml</code> support is being developed.</p>

			 <p>Facebook was fantastic as a college kid: it was just an exclusive club for your an your dorm mates. Then everyone got on Facebook and the content became less and less relevant. Twitter was fantastic as a way to connect with techy astronomy colleagues. It felt like our own little back channel. Then Twitter became a political battle ground, and although the conversations were powerful, they were also overwhelming. Instagram was an oasis where there was no politics, just photos of your day. A way to connect with faraway friends. Now <a href="https://debugger.medium.com/instagram-has-become-skymall-68b9f2fbbc30">Instagram has become Skymall</a>. Does the utility of all social media platforms self-implode at some point under the weight of growth and ad sales?</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;ve lost the tune with social media. I haven&rsquo;t used Facebook or kept up with my Twitter timeline in years. I keep feeling bad whenever I open Instagram. And that&rsquo;s fine. I have more time for meaningful work. But I also feel like I&rsquo;m disappearing off the face of the internet by no longer engaging with social media.</p>
<p>So here we are in 2021. What should my social existence on the web look like?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try going back to the basics. I&rsquo;m going to resolve to own my own corner of the web with <a href="https://jonathansick.ca">jonathansick.ca</a> and no longer rent space from social media companies. I&rsquo;m also going to see how this micro.blog site fits in. I initially signed up in 2017. The concept of the indie web didn&rsquo;t fully connect with me back then, but now its clear that building my own site and paying directly for services and apps is the way that I want to exist on the web going forward.</p>
