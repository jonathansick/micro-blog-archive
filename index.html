			 <p>Judging from media, email fliers, and friends, it seems like we (Canadians) are just going ahead with a boycott of American brands â€” tariffs or not.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been wondering why Trump would make an own-goal with his trade war. This <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-how-are-we-so-befuddled-at-us-tariffs-when-its-all-been-so-obvious/">Globe &amp; Mail piece</a> by Turley-Ewart is the best lead yet by linking to a paper by a Trump economist that lays it out in its dangerous, illogical glory: <a href="https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199_A_Users_Guide_to_Restructuring_the_Global_Trading_System.pdf">A User&rsquo;s Guide to Reconstructing the Global Trading System</a>.</p>

			 <p>What a time to be renewing a mortgage. Interest rates in Canada have been steadily going down with perhaps 50 to 75 basis points to go, making a variable rate look good. And this trade war could further reduce interest rates&hellip; Or! it could trigger inflation causing interest rates to go up.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://marcosatanaka.com">Play</a> version 2.4.1 added the ability to hide all shorts from its YouTube channels inbox. This is such a great feature because so many YouTube shorts seem to be empty derivatives of regular videos and don&rsquo;t make sense when you&rsquo;re trying to be deliberate about your YouTube viewing with Play.</p>

			 <p>-21ËšC and the furnace gave up last night. Thankfully we have some redundant forms of heating and some friends dropped off extra space heaters so we should be able to keep things going until a tech arrives.</p>
