I&rsquo;m finding these reviews, even if I&rsquo;m the only person who interacts with them, are a useful for gauging progress. <a href=\"https://www.jonathansick.blog/categories/reviews/\" title=\"Reviews category\">You can find my past monthly reviews here on the micro blog.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"doing-the-work\">Doing the work</h2>\n<h3 id=\"documentation-engineering-for-phalanx\">Documentation engineering for Phalanx</h3>\n<p>My highlight for October at <a href=\"https://www.lsst.org\">Rubin Observatory</a> was overhauling the <a href=\"https://phalanx.lsst.io\">documentation for Phalanx</a>. Phalanx is how we deploy the Rubin Science Platform across different environments, whether it&rsquo;s in Google Cloud or at institutional data facilities. The first phase of that work was to re-organize (and in many cases, edit and augment) the content into core categories (Overview, Application Developers, and Environment Administrators). I think the <a href=\"https://documenteer.lsst.io/guides/index.html\">new theme</a> is really working well for this purpose, with the top-level sections clearly defining different domains in the documentation.</p>\n<p>On top of that narrative documentation, I built out two reference categories for applications and environments. These pages are intended to provide quick access to information about apps and environments. You can get a link to an application in an environment&rsquo;s Argo CD, or see what environments an application runs in, or see what groups are configured with different authorization scopes, and so on. All of this information is already embedded within the Phalanx repository (an Argo CD GitOps repo, <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst-sqre/phalanx\">lsst-sqre/phalanx</a>), so I engineered the Sphinx documentation build to pull the necessary information automatically. Essentially, in the Sphinx <code>conf.py</code> file I fire off a Python service that crawls the Phalanx repository&rsquo;s Helm charts to collect datasets for each app and service. These get loaded in Jinja templating environments for <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-jinja/\">sphinx-jinja</a>, which I use to render out templated reStructuredText content, such as tables, just in time for the Sphinx documentation build. These are the things I really love about docs-like-code and a system like Sphinx ‚Äî there are lots of entry points for creating very custom documentation tooling that enable us to document things accurately and efficiently.</p>\n<h3 id=\"technote\">Technote</h3>\n<p>In November, I started working on a brand-new project called <em>Technote</em>. It&rsquo;s on GitHub at <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst-sqre/technote\">lsst-sqre/technote</a>. At Rubin, we&rsquo;ve been using technical notes or &ldquo;technotes&rdquo; since 2015 when we introduced them. You can read in <a href=\"https://sqr-000.lsst.io\">SQR-000</a> why we created the technote format, and how we use it. The gist is that technotes are a lightweight documentation format for communicating within and across teams that is built on GitHub as the core platform for collaboration, and static web servers as the presentation platform (in our case, <a href=\"https://sqr-006.lsst.io\"><em>LSST the Docs</em></a>, but you could use GitHub Pages or Read the Docs effectively too).</p>\n<p>Initially, we created technotes just for ourselves in SQuaRE, but over time the format was organically adopted by more and more teams throughout the observatory. There are several hundred technotes already at Rubin (you can find them at <a href=\"https://www.lsst.io\">www.lsst.io</a>). Although the format took off, the Rubin technote platform stayed on the original Sphinx prototype theme I created in 2015 ‚Äî a hacked version of the Read the Docs theme. And yes, you can now write technotes in LaTeX, but HTML-native technotes are still at the heart of the platform.</p>\n<p>This month, at last, I carved out work time to start properly engineering the technote document format. At its core, the <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst-sqre/technote\">Technote</a> package provides a Sphinx theme that&rsquo;s geared towards single page articles (i.e., technotes) that have a title, document identifier, abstract, and other metadata like author lists and versioning information. <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst-sqre/technote\">Technote</a> is a base layer, so organizations like Rubin and others can customize the branding and design of their documents. The long-term goal is to enable team members to write technotes in reStructuredText, Markdown, or Jupyter Notebooks, and render technotes in HTML, EPUB, and PDF (for archives). It&rsquo;s early days, but I think there&rsquo;s considerable potential in enabling teams to write documents on GitHub that are shared on the web.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pursuits\">Pursuits</h2>\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;ve been making a lot of progress down in the woodshop, but my current goal is to organize the shop space into something that&rsquo;s functional for both woodworking / making and also home storage.</p>\n<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m panelling a small section of wall under the stairs in maple plywood. I&rsquo;ve ship lapped the panels and painted the rabbets with a splash of mint green. That wall will become the future home for my tool chest and a network cabinet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reading\">Reading</h2>\n<p>Amanda and I have been reading <em>The Golden Enclaves</em>, the third book in Naomi Novak&rsquo;s Scholomance series. They&rsquo;ve made it out of the Scholomance ‚Äî now they&rsquo;re facing the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world of wizards.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve also been on a personal knowledge management kick, trying to figure out how to build a system for gathering information and making it accessible to me. I read Tiago Forte&rsquo;s <em>Building a Second Brain</em>, which I think is a system that has a lot of good ideas. I&rsquo;ve also been re-reading <em>How to take smart notes</em> by Sonke Ahrens, who teaches the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten\">Zettlekasten</a> system of literature notes and atomic permanent notes ‚Äî and leaves project management aside. In some ways Ahrens' approach is more appealing because I can see it scaling more easily than Forte&rsquo;s approach of literally moving notes from one bucket to another. I&rsquo;m working out how all of these ideas can become a personal knowledge management system for myself, centred around DEVONthink.</p>\n<h2 id=\"heavy-rotation\">Heavy rotation</h2>\n<p>Carly Rae Jepson and Taylor Swift both released albums on the same day, so apologies to other artists but these are all I&rsquo;ve been listening to lately.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m in love with CRJ&rsquo;s <em>The Loneliest Time</em>, and the title track with Rufus Wainright is my personal hit for the year. I also especially love <em>Surrender My Heart</em>, <em>So Nice</em>, and <em>Shooting Star</em>. Actually, every song is a banger. Full stop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"on-screen\">On screen</h2>\n<p>Season 6 of the <em>Great Canadian Baking Show</em> was a fantastic display of diversity. Don&rsquo;t pay any attention to the dribble that the <em>Walrus</em> publishes about it.</p>\n<p><em>Sort of</em> season 2 on CBC Gem started and it&rsquo;s a brilliant masterpiece.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve also started watching <em>Orphan Black</em>, which I missed out on when it originally aired. Tatiana Maslany&rsquo;s acting is astonishing.</p>\n",

You can get a link to an application in an environment's Argo CD, or see what environments an application runs in, or see what groups are configured with different authorization scopes, and so on. All of this information is already embedded within the Phalanx repository (an Argo CD GitOps repo, [lsst-sqre/phalanx](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/phalanx)), so I engineered the Sphinx documentation build to pull the necessary information automatically. Essentially, in the Sphinx `conf.py` file I fire off a Python service that crawls the Phalanx repository's Helm charts to collect datasets for each app and service. These get loaded in Jinja templating environments for [sphinx-jinja](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-jinja/), which I use to render out templated reStructuredText content, such as tables, just in time for the Sphinx documentation build. These are the things I really love about docs-like-code and a system like Sphinx ‚Äî there are lots of entry points for creating very custom documentation tooling that enable us to document things accurately and efficiently.\n\n### Technote\nIn November, I started working on a brand-new project called *Technote*. It's on GitHub at [lsst-sqre/technote](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/technote). At Rubin, we've been using technical notes or \"technotes\" since 2015 when we introduced them. You can read in [SQR-000](https://sqr-000.lsst.io) why we created the technote format, and how we use it. The gist is that technotes are a lightweight documentation format for communicating within and across teams that is built on GitHub as the core platform for collaboration, and static web servers as the presentation platform (in our case, [*LSST the Docs*](https://sqr-006.lsst.io), but you could use GitHub Pages or Read the Docs effectively too).\n\nInitially, we created technotes just for ourselves in SQuaRE, but over time the format was organically adopted by more and more teams throughout the observatory. There are several hundred technotes already at Rubin (you can find them at [www.lsst.io](https://www.lsst.io)). Although the format took off, the Rubin technote platform stayed on the original Sphinx prototype theme I created in 2015 ‚Äî a hacked version of the Read the Docs theme. And yes, you can now write technotes in LaTeX, but HTML-native technotes are still at the heart of the platform.\n\nThis month, at last, I carved out work time to start properly engineering the technote document format. At its core, the [Technote](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/technote) package provides a Sphinx theme that's geared towards single page articles (i.e., technotes) that have a title, document identifier, abstract, and other metadata like author lists and versioning information. [Technote](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/technote) is a base layer, so organizations like Rubin and others can customize the branding and design of their documents. The long-term goal is to enable team members to write technotes in reStructuredText, Markdown, or Jupyter Notebooks, and render technotes in HTML, EPUB, and PDF (for archives). It's early days, but I think there's considerable potential in enabling teams to write documents on GitHub that are shared on the web.\n\n## Pursuits\nIt doesn't feel like I've been making a lot of progress down in the woodshop, but my current goal is to organize the shop space into something that's functional for both woodworking / making and also home storage.\n\nCurrently, I'm panelling a small section of wall under the stairs in maple plywood. I've ship lapped the panels and painted the rabbets with a splash of mint green. That wall will become the future home for my tool chest and a network cabinet. \n\n## Reading\nAmanda and I have been reading *The Golden Enclaves*, the third book in Naomi Novak's Scholomance series. They've made it out of the Scholomance ‚Äî now they're facing the \"real\" world of wizards.\n\nI've also been on a personal knowledge management kick, trying to figure out how to build a system for gathering information and making it accessible to me. I read Tiago Forte's *Building a Second Brain*, which I think is a system that has a lot of good ideas. I've also been re-reading *How to take smart notes* by Sonke Ahrens, who teaches the [Zettlekasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) system of literature notes and atomic permanent notes ‚Äî and leaves project management aside. In some ways Ahrens' approach is more appealing because I can see it scaling more easily than Forte's approach of literally moving notes from one bucket to another. I'm working out how all of these ideas can become a personal knowledge management system for myself, centred around DEVONthink.\n\n## Heavy rotation\nCarly Rae Jepson and Taylor Swift both released albums on the same day, so apologies to other artists but these are all I've been listening to lately.\n\nI'm in love with CRJ's *The Loneliest Time*, and the title track with Rufus Wainright is my personal hit for the year. I also especially love *Surrender My Heart*, *So Nice*, and *Shooting Star*. Actually, every song is a banger. Full stop.\n\n## On screen\nSeason 6 of the *Great Canadian Baking Show* was a fantastic display of diversity. Don't pay any attention to the dribble that the *Walrus* publishes about it.\n\n*Sort of* season 2 on CBC Gem started and it's a brilliant masterpiece.\n\nWe've also started watching *Orphan Black*, which I missed out on when it originally aired. Tatiana Maslany's acting is astonishing.\n\n",

Times Square is in semi-stealth mode (they&rsquo;re both currently public open source), but I can&rsquo;t wait to see how they get used by Rubin teams.</p>\n<p>Next, I spent some time working on a new Cookiecutter template for <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst/templates/tree/main/project_templates/square_pypi_package\">&ldquo;SQuaRE-style&rdquo; Python packages that are published to PyPI</a>. We&rsquo;ve been informally copying the same patterns between our major libraries like <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst-sqre/safir\">Safir</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst-sqre/documenteer\">Documenteer</a>, but this template formalizes the basic structure for a SQuaRE package. It also provided us a chance to update our best practices. For instance, we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"https://www.jonathansick.blog\">switched to pyproject.toml entirely for project metadata, as I wrote about on this blog.</a> Second, I wanted to find a way to make our common GitHub Actions workflows more maintainable. It turns out that composite GitHub Actions are a low-overhead way of grouping sequences of actions together. The result is that the &ldquo;user&rdquo; workflows are both shorter and have less code to maintain since all the logic is now maintained in centralized actions. So far I&rsquo;ve made three composite actions: <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst-sqre/run-tox\">lsst-sqre/run-tox</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst-sqre/ltd-upload\">lsst-sqre/ltd-upload</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst-sqre/build-and-publish-to-pypi\">lsst-sqre/build-and-publish-to-pypi</a>.</p>\n<p>I refreshed some of the Kafka infrastructure that SQuaRE uses internally and provides to the rest of Rubin Observatory. First, I updated the packaging for <a href=\"https://kafkit.lsst.io\">Kafkit</a>, our Python package for encoding Kafka messages in conjunction with the Confluent Schema Registry. Kafkit is also available on conda-forge now at <a href=\"https://github.com/conda-forge/kafkit-feedstock\">conda-forge/kafkit-feedstock</a>. I also overhauled Strimzi Registry Operator, our Kubernetes operator for deploying the Confluence Schema Registry on a Strimzi-deployed Kafka cluster. One bit of that refresh I&rsquo;m really happy with is <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst-sqre/strimzi-registry-operator/pull/57\">a PR that deploys Kafka, the operator, and a Schema Registry in minikube within GitHub Actions</a>. This technique for building an application within minikube has a lot of potential as way of running integration tests for a lot of our microservices.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I&rsquo;ve also been thinking more about my online presence, including the viability of Instagram and my years-long absence from Twitter. I&rsquo;ve started to invest effort into <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a> as a way of owning my content and cross-posting to Twitter and Instagram where it makes sense. Social media was really important for launching my career, but while working Rubin I&rsquo;ve let it all drop off. It feel like it&rsquo;s time to re-emerge, but on my own terms. I feel like we&rsquo;re doing a lot of cool stuff at Rubin, and it&rsquo;s time to share it with the world now that we&rsquo;re getting closer to first light.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pursuits\">Pursuits</h2>\n<p>I got a DJI Mini 3 micro drone. The technology is astounding. I&rsquo;ve been steadily learning its flying functionality and just barely digging into its camera functionality.

				"content_text": "This is the first edition of what I intend to be a monthly round-up of the month. I'm doing this a bit for you ‚Äî to keep tabs on what I'm up to ‚Äî and also a bit for me to reflect on where my focus and effort are.[FN](The%20idea%20of%20a%20weekly%20review%20comes%20from%20David%20Sparks,%20who%20talks%20about%20it%20frequently%20on%20his%20[MacSparky%20blog](https://www.macsparky.com)%20and%20in%20training%20courses.%20Reviews%20are%20also%20a%20bit%20part%20of%20productivity%20methodolgies%20taught%20by%20[The%20Focus%20Course](https://thefocuscourse.com)%20and%20[Getting%20Things%20done](https://gettingthingsdone.com).)\n\n## Doing the work\nI started the month wrapping up basic [GitHub Checks integration](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/times-square/pull/41) for Times Square, a dynamic Jupyter notebook publishing service for the Rubin Science Platform. Times Square is in semi-stealth mode (they're both currently public open source), but I can't wait to see how they get used by Rubin teams.\n\nNext, I spent some time working on a new Cookiecutter template for [\"SQuaRE-style\" Python packages that are published to PyPI](https://github.com/lsst/templates/tree/main/project_templates/square_pypi_package). We've been informally copying the same patterns between our major libraries like [Safir](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/safir) and [Documenteer](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/documenteer), but this template formalizes the basic structure for a SQuaRE package. It also provided us a chance to update our best practices. For instance, we've [switched to pyproject.toml entirely for project metadata, as I wrote about on this blog.](https://www.jonathansick.blog) Second, I wanted to find a way to make our common GitHub Actions workflows more maintainable. It turns out that composite GitHub Actions are a low-overhead way of grouping sequences of actions together. The result is that the \"user\" workflows are both shorter and have less code to maintain since all the logic is now maintained in centralized actions. So far I've made three composite actions: [lsst-sqre/run-tox](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/run-tox), [lsst-sqre/ltd-upload](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/ltd-upload), and [lsst-sqre/build-and-publish-to-pypi](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/build-and-publish-to-pypi).\n\nI refreshed some of the Kafka infrastructure that SQuaRE uses internally and provides to the rest of Rubin Observatory. First, I updated the packaging for [Kafkit](https://kafkit.lsst.io), our Python package for encoding Kafka messages in conjunction with the Confluent Schema Registry. Kafkit is also available on conda-forge now at [conda-forge/kafkit-feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/kafkit-feedstock). I also overhauled Strimzi Registry Operator, our Kubernetes operator for deploying the Confluence Schema Registry on a Strimzi-deployed Kafka cluster. One bit of that refresh I'm really happy with is [a PR that deploys Kafka, the operator, and a Schema Registry in minikube within GitHub Actions](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/strimzi-registry-operator/pull/57). This technique for building an application within minikube has a lot of potential as way of running integration tests for a lot of our microservices.\n\nLastly, I've also been thinking more about my online presence, including the viability of Instagram and my years-long absence from Twitter. I've started to invest effort into [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) as a way of owning my content and cross-posting to Twitter and Instagram where it makes sense. Social media was really important for launching my career, but while working Rubin I've let it all drop off. It feel like it's time to re-emerge, but on my own terms. I feel like we're doing a lot of cool stuff at Rubin, and it's time to share it with the world now that we're getting closer to first light.\n\n## Pursuits\nI got a DJI Mini 3 micro drone. The technology is astounding. I've been steadily learning its flying functionality and just barely digging into its camera functionality. I'm also playing around with editing the drone footage on my iPad with LumaFusion. It really feels like the future.\n\n## Reading\nFinished *The Cartographers* by Peng Shepherd and *Tongues of Serpents* by Naomi Novik (with Amanda).

				"content_html": "<p>Last week I worked on <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst/templates/tree/main/project_templates/square_pypi_package\">a new template for PyPI python projects</a> for SQuaRE, my team at Rubin Observatory.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> One of the banner features in this new template is that we did away with <code>setup.cfg</code> and went all-in with <code>pyproject.toml</code> for defining our projects' packaging.</p>\n<h2 id=\"peps-517-518-and-621\">PEPs 517, 518 and 621</h2>\n<p>First, a reminder of what&rsquo;s going on with Python packaging. <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/\">PEP 517</a> and <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/\">PEP 518</a> introduced the idea of a &ldquo;build-system independent format for source trees.&rdquo; Up to that point, the assumption was that all Python projects would be built with setuptools.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> A build-system independent format lets you specify an alternative build backend, but in a standardized way, so that a front-end like <code>pip</code> can build and install the package regardless. In the SQuaRE team, though we use setuptools, we embraced PEP 517 and added <code>pyroject.toml</code> files containing a <code>[build-system]</code> table. However, our project metadata remained in <code>setup.cfg</code>, where setuptools expects it.</p>\n<p>Then in <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/\">PEP 621</a>, Python introduced a standardized schema for storing a project&rsquo;s metadata (everything from its name to its dependencies) in a <code>[project]</code> table of <code>project.toml</code> files. At this point, it seemed as if we could finally drop <code>setup.cfg</code> files from our projects entirely.</p>\n<p>Well, almost. The last straw was for setuptools itself to support <code>pyproject.toml</code> configurations for aspects of the build that are specific to setuptools, like package discovery. Currently, the support for a <code>[tool.setuptools]</code> table in pyproject.toml is in beta, but it exists and that was good enough for our team to start supporting it.</p>\n<p>And with that, we can now package our Python projects with only a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file, dropping <code>setup.cfg</code> and (almost) <code>setup.py</code> (more on this later).</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-template-pyprojecttoml\">Our template pyproject.toml</h2>\n<p>This is the example pyproject.toml from our template (and here&rsquo;s the related <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst/templates/blob/main/project_templates/square_pypi_package/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.pypi_name%7D%7D/pyproject.toml\">Jinja2/cookiecutter template</a> for it).

The <code>[tool.setuptools.packages.find]</code> table is where we configure this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"setuppy-is-still-necessary-for-now\">setup.py is still necessary, for now</h2>\n<p>Our original goal with this new template was to do away with the &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; packaging files: <code>setup.cfg</code> and <code>setup.py</code>. We did succeed in doing away with <code>setup.cfg</code> since not only has <code>setuptools</code> moved to <code>pyproject.toml</code>, but nearly every other tool using <code>setup.cfg</code> has moved their configurations as well.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>It might seem like <code>setup.py</code> is also obsolete. However, in our experience, some projects still require it for editable installs <code>pip install -e .</code>. We often use editable installs during development to rapidly test and prototype, so this is a useful feature for us. For that reason, we&rsquo;ve had to re-add a basic <code>setup.py</code> file to our projects:</p>\n<pre><code>from setuptools import setup\n\nsetup()\n</code></pre>\n<p>What&rsquo;s surprising is that, anecdotally, not all setuptools-based projects seem to need a <code>setup.py</code> for their editable installs.</p>\n<p>Regardless, <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2816\">setuptools issue 2816</a> is worth a subscription to learn when this has changed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"concatenated-readmes-with-markdown-may-not-work\">Concatenated READMEs with Markdown may not work</h2>\n<p>With the new <code>[project]</code> table in <code>pyproject.toml</code>, you can set a <code>readme</code> field that links to your project&rsquo;s README file. This effectively replaces the old &ldquo;long description&rdquo; field, where, back in the <code>setup.py</code> days, we&rsquo;d write a small function to open and insert text from the README file. This is a nice, clean way of standardizing that practice.</p>\n<p>Something I liked to do in our <code>setup.cfg</code> files was to actually concatenated multiple files into the long description:</p>\n<pre><code>[metadata]\nname = documenteer\nlong_description = file: README.rst, CHANGELOG.rst, LICENSE\nlong_description_content_type = text/x-rst\n</code></pre>\n<p>This way, the project&rsquo;s page on PyPI would include not only the README but also the change log, followed by the license. Nice.</p>\n<p>In <code>pyproject.toml</code>, the same can be accomplished by making the README <em>dynamic</em>:</p>\n<pre><code>[project]\ndynamic = [&quot;readme&quot;]\n\n[tool.setuptools.dynamic]\nreadme = {file = [&quot;README.rst&quot;, &quot;CHANGELOG.rst&quot;]}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And this works.

				"content_text": "Last week I worked on [a new template for PyPI python projects](https://github.com/lsst/templates/tree/main/project_templates/square_pypi_package) for SQuaRE, my team at Rubin Observatory.[^1] One of the banner features in this new template is that we did away with `setup.cfg` and went all-in with `pyproject.toml` for defining our projects' packaging.\n\n## PEPs 517, 518 and 621\nFirst, a reminder of what's going on with Python packaging. [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) and [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) introduced the idea of a \"build-system independent format for source trees.\" Up to that point, the assumption was that all Python projects would be built with setuptools.[^2] A build-system independent format lets you specify an alternative build backend, but in a standardized way, so that a front-end like `pip` can build and install the package regardless. In the SQuaRE team, though we use setuptools, we embraced PEP 517 and added `pyroject.toml` files containing a `[build-system]` table. However, our project metadata remained in `setup.cfg`, where setuptools expects it.\n\nThen in [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/), Python introduced a standardized schema for storing a project's metadata (everything from its name to its dependencies) in a `[project]` table of `project.toml` files. At this point, it seemed as if we could finally drop `setup.cfg` files from our projects entirely.\n\nWell, almost. The last straw was for setuptools itself to support `pyproject.toml` configurations for aspects of the build that are specific to setuptools, like package discovery. Currently, the support for a `[tool.setuptools]` table in pyproject.toml is in beta, but it exists and that was good enough for our team to start supporting it.\n\nAnd with that, we can now package our Python projects with only a `pyproject.toml` file, dropping `setup.cfg` and (almost) `setup.py` (more on this later).\n\n## Our template pyproject.toml\nThis is the example pyproject.toml from our template (and here's the related [Jinja2/cookiecutter template](https://github.com/lsst/templates/blob/main/project_templates/square_pypi_package/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.pypi_name%7D%7D/pyproject.toml) for it). You can also [see it in action with Kafkit](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/kafkit/blob/main/pyproject.toml), one of our Python packages for Kafka.\n\n\t[project]\n\t# https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/declaring-project-metadata/\n\tname = \"example\"\n\tdescription = \"Short one-sentence description of the package\"\n\tlicense = {file = \"LICENSE\"}\n\treadme= \"README.md\"\n\tkeywords = [\n\t    \"rubin\",\n\t    \"lsst\",\n\t]\n\t# https://pypi.org/classifiers/\n\tclassifiers = [\n\t    \"Development Status :: 4 - Beta\",\n\t    \"License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License\",\n\t    \"Programming Language :: Python\",\n\t    \"Programming Language :: Python :: 3\",\n\t    \"Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8\",\n\t    \"Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9\",\n\t    \"Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10\",\n\t    \"Intended Audience :: Developers\",\n\t    \"Natural Language :: English\",\n\t    \"Operating System :: POSIX\",\n\t    \"Typing :: Typed\",\n\t]\n\trequires-python = \">=3.8\"\n\tdependencies = []\n\tdynamic = [\"version\"]\n\t\n\t[project.optional-dependencies]\n\tdev = [\n\t    # Testing\n\t    \"coverage[toml]\",\n\t    \"pytest\",\n\t    \"pytest-asyncio\",\n\t    \"pre-commit\",\n\t    \"mypy\",\n\t    # Documentation\n\t    \"sphinx\",\n\t    \"documenteer\",\n\t    \"lsst-sphinx-bootstrap-theme\",\n\t    \"sphinx-prompt\",\n\t    \"sphinx-automodapi\",\n\t    \"myst-parser\",\n\t    \"markdown-it-py[linkify]\",\n\t]\n\t\n\t[project.urls]\n\t# Homepage = \"https://example.lsst.io\"\n\tSource = \"https://github.com/lsst-sqre/example\"\n\t\n\t[build-system]\n\trequires = [\n\t    \"setuptools>=61\",\n\t    \"wheel\",\n\t    \"setuptools_scm[toml]>=6.2\"\n\t]\n\tbuild-backend = \"setuptools.build_meta\"\n\t\n\t[tool.setuptools_scm]\n\t\n\t[tool.setuptools.packages.find]\n\t# https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html\n\twhere = [\"src\"]\n\tinclude = [\"example*\"]\n\t\n\t[tool.coverage.run]\n\tparallel = true\n\tbranch = true\n\tsource = [\"example\"]\n\t\n\t[tool.coverage.paths]\n\tsource = [\"src\", \".tox/*/site-packages\"]\n\t\n\t[tool.coverage.report]\n\tshow_missing = true\n\texclude_lines = [\n\t    \"pragma: no cover\",\n\t    \"def __repr__\",\n\t    \"if self.debug:\",\n\t    \"if settings.DEBUG\",\n\t    \"raise AssertionError\",\n\t    \"raise NotImplementedError\",\n\t    \"if 0:\",\n\t    \"if __name__ == .__main__.:\",\n\t    \"if TYPE_CHECKING:\"\n\t]\n\t\n\t[tool.black]\n\tline-length = 79\n\ttarget-version = [\"py38\"]\n\texclude = '''\n\t/(\n\t    \\.eggs\n\t  | \\.git\n\t  | \\.mypy_cache\n\t  | \\.tox\n\t  | \\.venv\n\t  | _build\n\t  | build\n\t  | dist\n\t)/\n\t'\n\t# Use single-quoted strings so TOML treats the string like a Python r-string\n\t#  Multi-line strings are implicitly treated by black as regular expressions\n\t\n\t[tool.pydocstyle]\n\t# Reference: http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/error_codes.html\n\tconvention = \"numpy\"\n\tadd_select = [\n\t    \"D212\" # Multi-line docstring summary should start at the first line\n\t]\n\tadd-ignore = [\n\t    \"D105\", # Missing docstring in magic method\n\t    \"D102\", # Missing docstring in public method (needed for docstring inheritance)\n\t    \"D100\", # Missing docstring in public module\n\t    # Below are required to allow multi-line summaries.\n\t    \"D200\", # One-line docstring should fit on one line with quotes\n\t    \"D205\", # 1 blank line required between summary line and description\n\t    \"D400\", # First line should end with a period\n\t    # Properties shouldn't be written in imperative mode.

The `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]` table is where we configure this.\n\n## setup.py is still necessary, for now\nOur original goal with this new template was to do away with the \"legacy\" packaging files: `setup.cfg` and `setup.py`. We did succeed in doing away with `setup.cfg` since not only has `setuptools` moved to `pyproject.toml`, but nearly every other tool using `setup.cfg` has moved their configurations as well.[^3]\n\nIt might seem like `setup.py` is also obsolete. However, in our experience, some projects still require it for editable installs `pip install -e .`. We often use editable installs during development to rapidly test and prototype, so this is a useful feature for us. For that reason, we've had to re-add a basic `setup.py` file to our projects:\n\n\tfrom setuptools import setup\n\t\n\tsetup()\n\nWhat's surprising is that, anecdotally, not all setuptools-based projects seem to need a `setup.py` for their editable installs.\n\nRegardless, [setuptools issue 2816](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2816) is worth a subscription to learn when this has changed.\n\n## Concatenated READMEs with Markdown may not work\nWith the new `[project]` table in `pyproject.toml`, you can set a `readme` field that links to your project's README file. This effectively replaces the old \"long description\" field, where, back in the `setup.py` days, we'd write a small function to open and insert text from the README file. This is a nice, clean way of standardizing that practice.\n\nSomething I liked to do in our `setup.cfg` files was to actually concatenated multiple files into the long description:\n\n\t[metadata]\n\tname = documenteer\n\tlong_description = file: README.rst, CHANGELOG.rst, LICENSE\n\tlong_description_content_type = text/x-rst\n\nThis way, the project's page on PyPI would include not only the README but also the change log, followed by the license. Nice.\n\nIn `pyproject.toml`, the same can be accomplished by making the README *dynamic*:\n\n\t[project]\n\tdynamic = [\"readme\"]\n\t\n\t[tool.setuptools.dynamic]\n\treadme = {file = [\"README.rst\", \"CHANGELOG.rst\"]}\n\nAnd this works. Where things went wrong for me is using Markdown for the README and CHANGELOG:\n\n\t[project]\n\tdynamic = [\"readme\"]\n\t\n\t[tool.setuptools.dynamic]\n\treadme = {file = [\"README.md\", \"CHANGELOG.md\"]}\n\nWhen I looked inside the built wheel's `METADATA` file, the `Description-Content-Type` would be `text/re-structured-text` instead of `text/markdown`. Normally, the tooling successfully detects the content type for the description, but this may not be working for dynamic READMEs. Something to be aware of, as setuptools' `pyproject.toml` support is being developed.\n\n## Further reading\n\n- [PyPA's documentation for declaring project metadata in pyproject.toml](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/declaring-project-metadata/)\n- [setuptools' documentation for pyproject.toml configuration](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html)\n\n[^1]:\t[We love to create templates](https://github.com/lsst/templates) because they enable us to standardize on technologies and workflows.
