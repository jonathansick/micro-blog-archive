Phalanx is how we deploy the Rubin Science Platform across different environments, whether it&rsquo;s in Google Cloud or at institutional data facilities. The first phase of that work was to re-organize (and in many cases, edit and augment) the content into core categories (Overview, Application Developers, and Environment Administrators).

These pages are intended to provide quick access to information about apps and environments. You can get a link to an application in an environment&rsquo;s Argo CD, or see what environments an application runs in, or see what groups are configured with different authorization scopes, and so on. All of this information is already embedded within the Phalanx repository (an Argo CD GitOps repo, <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst-sqre/phalanx\">lsst-sqre/phalanx</a>), so I engineered the Sphinx documentation build to pull the necessary information automatically. Essentially, in the Sphinx <code>conf.py</code> file I fire off a Python service that crawls the Phalanx repository&rsquo;s Helm charts to collect datasets for each app and service. These get loaded in Jinja templating environments for <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-jinja/\">sphinx-jinja</a>, which I use to render out templated reStructuredText content, such as tables, just in time for the Sphinx documentation build.

I&rsquo;ve known of Storybook for a while in the context of learning about design systems (hat tip to <a href=\"https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com\"><em>Atomic Design</em> by Brad Frost</a>), but I&rsquo;d always considered it to be something for big teams that had the resources to set up design documentation infrastructures for their web projects. Well, it turns out that not only is Storybook amazingly easy to drop into an existing React application, but it also solves some glaring problems in my web development workflow. React components can have behaviours that depend on state. Working with state while developing components can be, quite frankly, a pain. With Storybook, I can now inject state into &ldquo;stories&rdquo; about my components, and even adjust that state in real time to see how the component adapts. You can see this initial Storybook related work in <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/87\" title=\"Initial integration with Storybook\">lsst-sqre/squareone#87</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/93\" title=\"Develop Times Square UI with storybook\">lsst-sqre/squareone#93</a>.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of the month, I moved on to another Rubin web project: theming Rubin&rsquo;s Sphinx documentation sites. We&rsquo;re trying out <a href=\"https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">pydata-sphinx-theme</a>, which features a three column design (navigation — content — content headers) and a novel top navigation bar. Because that top navigation bar is populated from the root-level <code>toctree</code> elements of a Sphinx site, adopting <a href=\"https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">pydata-sphinx-theme</a> can take some content re-organization. I&rsquo;ve implemented the theme in <a href=\"https://documenteer.lsst.io\">Documenteer</a>, and I really like the result. My pull request to set up a Rubin configuration for Sphinx documentation is <a href=\"https://github.com/lsst-sqre/documenteer/pull/129\" title=\"Adopt pydata-sphinx-theme\">lsst-sqre/documenteer#129</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"pursuits\">Pursuits</h2>\n<p>Down in the wood shop (I can&rsquo;t decide whether I want to call it a <em>wood shop</em> or <em>workshop</em> or even a <em>studio</em>) I made solid progress on my tool chest, based on the boarded chest in the <a href=\"https://lostartpress.com/products/the-anarchists-design-book\"><em>Anarchist&rsquo;s Design Book</em></a> by Schwarz. I used my combination plane to make rabbets and nailed the chest walls together with fantastically-strong 2&quot; cut nails. Then I used the combination plane to make tongue-and-groove joints for the bottom boards and nailed each board on, again with the 2&quot; cut nails. I slightly mis-aligned one board while nailing it, and after failing to pull out the nails, realized that these cut nails have fantastic holding strength. I&rsquo;m not worried about the chest bottom falling out. Now I&rsquo;ve pivoted to making a set of low Krenovian saw horses to temporarily hold the chest at a workable height before I make a permanent stand (which could be months, years, or decades down the road).</p>\n<p>Amanda and I got out for a bit more kayaking, and I shot and edited together <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vSK9JYTC_Mc\">a short video of us paddling around</a>. It&rsquo;s kind of dorky, but it&rsquo;s also astonishing to think that we now have consumer-grade flying cameras that can follow people around perfectly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reading\">Reading</h2>\n<p>Finished reading <em>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</em> by Haruki Murakami, <em>The Book of M</em> by Peng Shepard, and <em>Boyfriend Material</em> by Alexis Hall.

Something about the anti-skip being a bit too strong, I think? But I really enjoyed listening to records of She &amp; Him&rsquo;s <em>Melt Away: A Tribute to Brian Wilson</em> and Lizzo&rsquo;s <em>Special.</em> I must have had Sylvan Esso&rsquo;s <em>No Rules Sandy</em> on repeat through most work days.

I've known of Storybook for a while in the context of learning about design systems (hat tip to [*Atomic Design* by Brad Frost](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com)), but I'd always considered it to be something for big teams that had the resources to set up design documentation infrastructures for their web projects. Well, it turns out that not only is Storybook amazingly easy to drop into an existing React application, but it also solves some glaring problems in my web development workflow. React components can have behaviours that depend on state. Working with state while developing components can be, quite frankly, a pain. With Storybook, I can now inject state into \"stories\" about my components, and even adjust that state in real time to see how the component adapts. You can see this initial Storybook related work in [lsst-sqre/squareone#87](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/87 \"Initial integration with Storybook\") and [lsst-sqre/squareone#93](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/squareone/pull/93 \"Develop Times Square UI with storybook\").\n\nTowards the end of the month, I moved on to another Rubin web project: theming Rubin's Sphinx documentation sites. We're trying out [pydata-sphinx-theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which features a three column design (navigation — content — content headers) and a novel top navigation bar. Because that top navigation bar is populated from the root-level `toctree` elements of a Sphinx site, adopting [pydata-sphinx-theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) can take some content re-organization. I've implemented the theme in [Documenteer](https://documenteer.lsst.io), and I really like the result. My pull request to set up a Rubin configuration for Sphinx documentation is [lsst-sqre/documenteer#129](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/documenteer/pull/129 \"Adopt pydata-sphinx-theme\")\n\n## Pursuits\nDown in the wood shop (I can't decide whether I want to call it a *wood shop* or *workshop* or even a *studio*) I made solid progress on my tool chest, based on the boarded chest in the [*Anarchist's Design Book*](https://lostartpress.com/products/the-anarchists-design-book) by Schwarz. I used my combination plane to make rabbets and nailed the chest walls together with fantastically-strong 2\" cut nails. Then I used the combination plane to make tongue-and-groove joints for the bottom boards and nailed each board on, again with the 2\" cut nails. I slightly mis-aligned one board while nailing it, and after failing to pull out the nails, realized that these cut nails have fantastic holding strength. I'm not worried about the chest bottom falling out. Now I've pivoted to making a set of low Krenovian saw horses to temporarily hold the chest at a workable height before I make a permanent stand (which could be months, years, or decades down the road).\n\nAmanda and I got out for a bit more kayaking, and I shot and edited together [a short video of us paddling around](https://youtu.be/vSK9JYTC_Mc). It's kind of dorky, but it's also astonishing to think that we now have consumer-grade flying cameras that can follow people around perfectly.\n\n## Reading\nFinished reading *Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World* by Haruki Murakami, *The Book of M* by Peng Shepard, and *Boyfriend Material* by Alexis Hall. Resumed the Gabriel Allon series with Amanda: we're on *The Rembrandt Affair* by Daniel Silva.\n\n## Heavy rotation\nThe tracking on my U-Turn Orbit turntable went for a (literal) loop this month. Something about the anti-skip being a bit too strong, I think? But I really enjoyed listening to records of She & Him's *Melt Away: A Tribute to Brian Wilson* and Lizzo's *Special.* I must have had Sylvan Esso's *No Rules Sandy* on repeat through most work days. And after watching Dua Lipa's episode on *Song Exploder,* I dug a bit into her *Future Nostalgia* album.\n\n",

In the SQuaRE team, though we use setuptools, we embraced PEP 517 and added <code>pyroject.toml</code> files containing a <code>[build-system]</code> table. However, our project metadata remained in <code>setup.cfg</code>, where setuptools expects it.</p>\n<p>Then in <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/\">PEP 621</a>, Python introduced a standardized schema for storing a project&rsquo;s metadata (everything from its name to its dependencies) in a <code>[project]</code> table of <code>project.toml</code> files. At this point, it seemed as if we could finally drop <code>setup.cfg</code> files from our projects entirely.</p>\n<p>Well, almost. The last straw was for setuptools itself to support <code>pyproject.toml</code> configurations for aspects of the build that are specific to setuptools, like package discovery.

We did succeed in doing away with <code>setup.cfg</code> since not only has <code>setuptools</code> moved to <code>pyproject.toml</code>, but nearly every other tool using <code>setup.cfg</code> has moved their configurations as well.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>It might seem like <code>setup.py</code> is also obsolete. However, in our experience, some projects still require it for editable installs <code>pip install -e .</code>. We often use editable installs during development to rapidly test and prototype, so this is a useful feature for us. For that reason, we&rsquo;ve had to re-add a basic <code>setup.py</code> file to our projects:</p>\n<pre><code>from setuptools import setup\n\nsetup()\n</code></pre>\n<p>What&rsquo;s surprising is that, anecdotally, not all setuptools-based projects seem to need a <code>setup.py</code> for their editable installs.</p>\n<p>Regardless, <a href=\"https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2816\">setuptools issue 2816</a> is worth a subscription to learn when this has changed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"concatenated-readmes-with-markdown-may-not-work\">Concatenated READMEs with Markdown may not work</h2>\n<p>With the new <code>[project]</code> table in <code>pyproject.toml</code>, you can set a <code>readme</code> field that links to your project&rsquo;s README file. This effectively replaces the old &ldquo;long description&rdquo; field, where, back in the <code>setup.py</code> days, we&rsquo;d write a small function to open and insert text from the README file. This is a nice, clean way of standardizing that practice.</p>\n<p>Something I liked to do in our <code>setup.cfg</code> files was to actually concatenated multiple files into the long description:</p>\n<pre><code>[metadata]\nname = documenteer\nlong_description = file: README.rst, CHANGELOG.rst, LICENSE\nlong_description_content_type = text/x-rst\n</code></pre>\n<p>This way, the project&rsquo;s page on PyPI would include not only the README but also the change log, followed by the license. Nice.</p>\n<p>In <code>pyproject.toml</code>, the same can be accomplished by making the README <em>dynamic</em>:</p>\n<pre><code>[project]\ndynamic = [&quot;readme&quot;]\n\n[tool.setuptools.dynamic]\nreadme = {file = [&quot;README.rst&quot;, &quot;CHANGELOG.rst&quot;]}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And this works. Where things went wrong for me is using Markdown for the README and CHANGELOG:</p>\n<pre><code>[project]\ndynamic = [&quot;readme&quot;]\n\n[tool.setuptools.dynamic]\nreadme = {file = [&quot;README.md&quot;, &quot;CHANGELOG.md&quot;]}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I looked inside the built wheel&rsquo;s <code>METADATA</code> file, the <code>Description-Content-Type</code> would be <code>text/re-structured-text</code> instead of <code>text/markdown</code>. Normally, the tooling successfully detects the content type for the description, but this may not be working for dynamic READMEs. Something to be aware of, as setuptools' <code>pyproject.toml</code> support is being developed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"further-reading\">Further reading</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/declaring-project-metadata/\">PyPA&rsquo;s documentation for declaring project metadata in pyproject.toml</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html\">setuptools' documentation for pyproject.toml configuration</a></li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/lsst/templates\">We love to create templates</a> because they enable us to standardize on technologies and workflows.

We did succeed in doing away with `setup.cfg` since not only has `setuptools` moved to `pyproject.toml`, but nearly every other tool using `setup.cfg` has moved their configurations as well.[^3]\n\nIt might seem like `setup.py` is also obsolete. However, in our experience, some projects still require it for editable installs `pip install -e .`. We often use editable installs during development to rapidly test and prototype, so this is a useful feature for us. For that reason, we've had to re-add a basic `setup.py` file to our projects:\n\n\tfrom setuptools import setup\n\t\n\tsetup()\n\nWhat's surprising is that, anecdotally, not all setuptools-based projects seem to need a `setup.py` for their editable installs.\n\nRegardless, [setuptools issue 2816](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2816) is worth a subscription to learn when this has changed.\n\n## Concatenated READMEs with Markdown may not work\nWith the new `[project]` table in `pyproject.toml`, you can set a `readme` field that links to your project's README file. This effectively replaces the old \"long description\" field, where, back in the `setup.py` days, we'd write a small function to open and insert text from the README file. This is a nice, clean way of standardizing that practice.\n\nSomething I liked to do in our `setup.cfg` files was to actually concatenated multiple files into the long description:\n\n\t[metadata]\n\tname = documenteer\n\tlong_description = file: README.rst, CHANGELOG.rst, LICENSE\n\tlong_description_content_type = text/x-rst\n\nThis way, the project's page on PyPI would include not only the README but also the change log, followed by the license. Nice.\n\nIn `pyproject.toml`, the same can be accomplished by making the README *dynamic*:\n\n\t[project]\n\tdynamic = [\"readme\"]\n\t\n\t[tool.setuptools.dynamic]\n\treadme = {file = [\"README.rst\", \"CHANGELOG.rst\"]}\n\nAnd this works. Where things went wrong for me is using Markdown for the README and CHANGELOG:\n\n\t[project]\n\tdynamic = [\"readme\"]\n\t\n\t[tool.setuptools.dynamic]\n\treadme = {file = [\"README.md\", \"CHANGELOG.md\"]}\n\nWhen I looked inside the built wheel's `METADATA` file, the `Description-Content-Type` would be `text/re-structured-text` instead of `text/markdown`. Normally, the tooling successfully detects the content type for the description, but this may not be working for dynamic READMEs. Something to be aware of, as setuptools' `pyproject.toml` support is being developed.\n\n## Further reading\n\n- [PyPA's documentation for declaring project metadata in pyproject.toml](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/declaring-project-metadata/)\n- [setuptools' documentation for pyproject.toml configuration](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html)\n\n[^1]:\t[We love to create templates](https://github.com/lsst/templates) because they enable us to standardize on technologies and workflows. Even though we have tens/hundreds of GitHub repositories at Rubin (depending on the organizational scope), working in these projects is familiar because they all share the same structure and technologies.\n\n[^2]:\tLike distutils and packaging — remember thee?\n\n[^3]:\tExcept flake8 — so we've booted flake8 to its own `.flake8` configuration file.\n",
